                   <td><p>Hello! My name is Shabana Ahmad and I'm a first year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. My interests include many different forms of art, such as drawing, painting, music, and photography. I love the idea of capturing beautiful things on paper or pictures, to make the moments last longer. Aside from studying, I also enjoy playing video games, going for walks, and spending time with my family. I watch many TV shows, but my alltime favourite is the show 'You'. Reading is also one of my favourite things to do apart from art. I also love beauty, styling hair and practicing my makeup skills.</p></td>
